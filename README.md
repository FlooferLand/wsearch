## Contributing

all the data is located inside [the artworks folder](./artworks).

If you want to make a pull request to add a new artwork, do so following the other entries
and make sure to follow the JSON schema.

I use [`miniserve`](https://lib.rs/crates/miniserve) for my watch server, so make sure its installed then run the "Serve generator" VSCode script.
